TODO add support for sublime and notepad++ autosave files ;)

With the new version of Notepad your progress will be automatically saved when you close Notepad. To do this Microsoft has made it so Notepad will save your files in a tabstate directory. notepad11thief is a tool designed to exfiltrate these tabstate files using smbclient and will parse them for data.
